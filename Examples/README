There are three example datasets.
Covid-19 Household data, Guangzhou, China: 
        Shuffled household data from the first wave of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. You can estimate secondary attack rate (SAR). 
        An E-M algorithm is used to impute infection times of asymptomatic cases. See  doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30471-0. 
Zika epidemic data, San Andres, Colombia: 
        Epidemic curve data (daily reported case numbers) used to estimate Rt during the 2015 wave of Zika in San Andres, Colombia.
Avian influenza outbreak data, Indonesia:
        An household outbreak data of avian influnza H5N1 in Indonesia. You can test whether there was human-to-human transmission.
Power:
        Use simulated data to conduct power calculation for covariate effect on reducing transmission probability.

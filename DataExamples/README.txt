There are three example datasets.
Covid_Households_Guangzhou: 
        Shuffled household data from the first wave of COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. You can estimate secondary attack rate (SAR). 
        An E-M algorithm is used to impute infection times of asymptomatic cases. See  doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30471-0. 
Rt_Wuhan: 
        Epidemic curve data (daily reported case numbers) used to estimate Rt during the first wave of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China 
Power:
        Use simulated data to conduct power calculation for covariate effect on reducing transmission probability.
